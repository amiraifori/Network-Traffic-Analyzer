### **Overview**

As cyber threats continue to evolve in complexity and scale, the need for intelligent network monitoring systems has become increasingly critical. Traditional rule-based traffic analyzers struggle to keep pace with dynamic network behaviors and zero-day attacks. This project addresses these limitations by developing a machine learning-based network traffic analyzer capable of detecting, classifying, and responding to anomalous traffic patterns with a high degree of accuracy and efficiency. By leveraging statistical analysis and supervised learning techniques, the system aims to enhance network visibility, improve threat detection, and support real-time decision-making.

### **Aim of the Project**

The aim of this project is to design and implement an intelligent network traffic analysis system that utilizes machine learning algorithms to automatically identify and classify network traffic, with the goal of improving the accuracy, speed, and adaptability of anomaly and intrusion detection.

### **Project Objectives**

1. To collect and preprocess network traffic data from live captures or established datasets.
2. To extract and engineer relevant features from raw packet data for machine learning analysis.
3. To evaluate various supervised learning algorithms for traffic classification and anomaly detection.
4. To measure model performance using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. To detect suspicious, unauthorized, or potentially malicious network behaviors in both labeled and unseen data.
6. (Optional) To develop a lightweight interface or dashboard for monitoring, visualizing, and alerting on network activity.

### **Key Research Questions**

* To what extent can machine learning algorithms effectively classify and detect anomalous network traffic?
* Which features of network traffic are most significant for accurate classification?
* What machine learning models yield the best performance in terms of accuracy and generalization to novel attack patterns?
* How well can the proposed system scale to real-time, high-volume network environments?
* What are the challenges and limitations of using machine learning in network security, particularly with respect to encrypted traffic and evolving threat vectors?

### **Problem Statement**

The rapid expansion of digital infrastructure has led to a dramatic increase in network traffic volume and complexity. Traditional network monitoring tools, which rely on static signatures and manual rule sets, are increasingly insufficient in detecting sophisticated or unknown attacks. This creates vulnerabilities in both enterprise and public networks, exposing critical systems to data breaches, service disruptions, and financial loss. A more adaptive and intelligent approach is required to automatically detect and classify anomalous behaviors in real-time, without relying on predefined attack signatures.

### **Proposed Solution**

This project proposes a machine learning-driven solution to network traffic analysis and anomaly detection. By capturing and preprocessing network data, extracting relevant statistical features, and training supervised learning models, the system will be capable of classifying traffic as benign or malicious. The use of publicly available datasets such as CICIDS2017 or NSL-KDD will enable model training and benchmarking. The final system will aim to offer enhanced detection capabilities, improved adaptability to emerging threats, and the potential for integration into broader security information and event management (SIEM) systems.
